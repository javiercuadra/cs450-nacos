            <h2>saturday, february 10 (part 2)</h2>
	    <p>
	    i am about to do some work on the PermissionGraphEngine. it looks like I am going to spending 
	    a lot of time on it, since I don't *really* know how it works in terms of actually generating 
	    graphs and whatnot. 
	    </p>
	    <ol>
		    <li>i think the move honestly is to just duplicate an existing .json file and 
			    then just try and build a graph from it </li> 
	    </ol> 
	    <h3>progress on PermissionGraphEngine</h3> 
	    <ol>  
		    <li> created new `Node` and `Edge` objects </li>  
		    <li> created logic for parsing the manifest file and creating graph nodes </li> 
	    </ol> 
	    <h3> todo for PermissionGraphEngine </h3>
	    <ol>  
		    <li> still need to create graph edges for the different types of edges </li> 
		    <li> still need to refactor code in order to utilie `Node` and `Edge` objects since they're goated </li> 
	    </ol> 
            <h2>saturday, february 10 (part 1)</h2>
            <p>created engine architecture:</p>
	    <ol> 
		    <li> <b>DONE</b> ManifestParser: parses a json manifest file</li>
		    <li>PermissionGraphEngine: generates a permission graph from manifest</li>
		    <li>PolicyGenerationEngine: generates microsegmentation policies from permission graph</li>
	    </ol>
